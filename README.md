# How to use this tool



1) Copy the git_auto.py to the directory which you want to upload to github 
2) Rename the extension of git_auto.py to git_auto.ppy (this will help in not uploading our git_auto.py file to github)
NOTE: You can also Make .exe of git_auto.py file
3) Run the git_auto.ppy using cmd in the same directory like (python git_auto.ppy) this cmd will run our python file
4) the program will ask for How many extension do you have in directory Like I Have 2 extension of c++ program i-e .cpp and .h So i will enter 2
5) Then program will ask for extension so I will enter .c++ .h 
6) then create repsotory in your Github and copy link of that repository and program will ask for that so paste it 
7) Done
